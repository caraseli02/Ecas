# Add Skeleton Loading States

## Problem Statement

The demo doesn't have skeleton loading states for async data fetching. When navigating between pages or loading data, users see empty or inconsistent UI transitions. For a portfolio showcase, this makes the demo feel less polished and "jumpy."

## Findings

**Current State:**

-   Product pages: Load data, show empty space until data arrives
-   Dashboard: No loading indicators for widgets
-   Search: No loading state while fetching results
-   Checkout: No loading states during transitions

**Missing Loading UI:**

-   Product card skeletons during catalog load
-   Table skeleton for orders/transactions lists
-   Widget skeletons for dashboard metrics
-   Detail page skeletons for product/user/order pages
-   Button loading states during form submissions

**Demo Impact:**

-   Low: UI feels "jumpy" and unpolished
-   Medium: Poor first impression during initial load
-   Low: Less professional portfolio presentation

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add Shadcn Skeleton Components

**Approach:**

-   Use shadcn/ui skeleton components (already available)
-   Add skeleton cards for product listings
-   Add skeleton table rows for dashboard data
-   Add skeleton widgets for dashboard metrics
-   Replace loading states with skeletons, show data when ready

**Pros:**

-   Matches existing design system
-   Professional, modern look
-   Easy to implement with existing components
-   Consistent styling

**Cons:**

-   Need to add skeleton to multiple pages
-   Requires managing loading states
-   Slightly more complex code

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Use Vuetify or Custom Skeleton Components

**Approach:**

-   Create custom skeleton components using Tailwind
-   Add shimmer animation effects
-   Implement loading overlay components
-   Apply across pages as needed

**Pros:**

-   Full control over appearance
-   Can match exact needs
-   Shimmer effects look polished

**Cons:**

-   More development effort
-   Need to maintain custom components
-   May look different from shadcn design system

**Effort:** 4-5 hours

**Risk:** Medium

---

### Option 3: Simple Loading Spinner/Overlay

**Approach:**

-   Use simple loading spinner or progress bar
-   Add loading overlay for page transitions
-   Show during data fetching, hide when data arrives
-   Minimal skeleton implementation

**Pros:**

-   Simplest to implement
-   Quick to add
-   Minimal code changes

**Cons:**

-   Less polished than skeletons
-   Doesn't maintain layout structure
-   Less impressive portfolio showcase

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action

**To be filled during triage.** Recommend Option 1 (Shadcn Skeleton Components) for best integration with existing design system.

## Technical Details

**Affected files:**

-   `components/skeletons/` - Create skeleton components directory
-   Create: `components/skeletons/ProductCardSkeleton.vue` - Product grid skeletons
-   Create: `components/skeletons/TableSkeleton.vue` - Table row skeletons
-   Create: `components/skeletons/WidgetSkeleton.vue` - Dashboard widget skeletons
-   Update: `pages/product/[slug].vue` - Add loading state
-   Update: `pages/dashboard/orders/index.vue` - Add table skeleton
-   Update: `pages/search.vue` - Add loading state for results

**Related components:**

-   Product grids
-   Dashboard tables
-   Search results
-   Product detail pages
-   Cart/checkout pages

**No database changes**

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] Skeleton components created for: cards, tables, widgets, detail pages
-   [ ] Product listing pages show skeleton cards during load
-   [ ] Dashboard tables show skeleton rows during load
-   [ ] Dashboard widgets show skeleton shapes during load
-   [ ] Search results show skeleton during fetch
-   [ ] Loading states have shimmer animation or polish
-   [ ] Transitions from loading → data are smooth
-   [ ] Skeletons match layout structure of content
-   [ ] All async data loading has loading states
-   [ ] Demo feels polished and professional

## Work Log

### 2026-02-14 - Initial Assessment

**By:** Portfolio Demo Review

**Actions:**

-   Reviewed loading states across demo
-   Identified missing skeletons (product lists, tables, widgets)
-   Evaluated 3 approaches to adding loading states
-   Researched shadcn skeleton components

**Learnings:**

-   Loading states are important for portfolio polish
-   Shadcn skeleton components match existing design system
-   Skeletons that match content structure feel most professional
-   Related to issue #004 (empty states) - both improve UX polish

---

## Notes

-   **Recommendation:** Option 1 (Shadcn Skeleton Components)
-   **Priority:** Medium impact on demo polish
-   **Related:** Issue #004 (empty states) - both UX improvements
