# Restore Calendar and Leaflet Styles Safely

## Problem Statement

Global stylesheet entries for Leaflet and V-Calendar were removed from Nuxt config to silence 404s, which can regress map/calendar UI rendering where those libraries are used.

## Findings

-   `nuxt.config.ts:59-64` no longer includes `leaflet/dist/leaflet.css` and `v-calendar/style.css`.
-   Removing global imports hides the loading error but shifts risk to runtime pages that depend on those styles.
-   The fix addresses symptom (404) instead of root cause (asset resolution/path/module config).

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Re-add global CSS and fix module/style resolution

**Approach:** Restore both CSS imports and correct upstream source of 404 (package resolution/build config).

**Pros:**

-   Preserves expected library visuals.
-   Avoids page-level regressions.

**Cons:**

-   Requires debugging why imports were 404ing.

**Effort:** Medium

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Move styles to route/component-level lazy imports

**Approach:** Import Leaflet/V-Calendar styles only where components are mounted.

**Pros:**

-   Smaller global CSS footprint.
-   Limits blast radius.

**Cons:**

-   Must guarantee every usage path imports styles.
-   Easy to miss routes.

**Effort:** Medium

**Risk:** Medium

## Recommended Action

## Technical Details

Affected files:

-   `/Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/nuxt.config.ts:59`

## Resources

-   Review context: current working tree code review

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] Leaflet map pages render with correct marker/layout styles.
-   [ ] V-Calendar widgets render with expected base styles.
-   [ ] No 404 errors remain for stylesheet assets.
-   [ ] Regression screenshots added for map/calendar views.

## Work Log

### 2026-02-18 - Code Review Finding

**By:** Codex

**Actions:**

-   Inspected Nuxt config diff and identified removed third-party stylesheet entries.
-   Assessed potential downstream UI regression impact.

**Learnings:**

-   Style import removal is a risky workaround for unresolved asset loading issues.

## Notes

-   Keep this tracked as regression prevention before merge.
