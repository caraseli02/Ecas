# Make regional preferences trigger dynamic

## Problem Statement

The header regional preferences trigger label is currently hardcoded (e.g. `EN · Lei`). For demo quality and correctness, it should reflect the user’s selected language/currency.

## Findings

-   Trigger lives in `components/layout/header/Index.vue`.
-   Label was changed from `| Lei` to `EN · Lei`, but it does not read selection state.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Bind label to a store/composable

**Approach:** Use the same state used by `LayoutRegionalPreferencesModal` (store or runtime config) to show current language and currency.

**Pros:**

-   Correct and consistent

**Cons:**

-   Requires identifying the source of truth for preferences

**Effort:** Small

**Risk:** Low

---

### Option 2: Derive from modal selections and emit changes

**Approach:** On save, emit selection and update header state.

**Pros:**

-   Localized change

**Cons:**

-   Risk of duplicating state

**Effort:** Medium

**Risk:** Medium

## Recommended Action

To be filled during triage.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] Header label matches selected language + currency after saving preferences
-   [ ] Works across refresh (persisted source of truth)
