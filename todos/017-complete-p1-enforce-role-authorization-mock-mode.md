# Enforce Role Authorization in Mock Mode

Customer users can access admin-only dashboard routes in mock mode.

## Problem Statement

Role authorization is bypassed entirely in mock mode, so any authenticated customer can open admin routes (`/dashboard/orders`, `/dashboard/customers`, etc.). This violates privileged area isolation and undermines the demo’s role-based access behavior.

## Findings

-   `middleware/router.global.ts:7` returns early in mock mode and skips permission checks.
-   With a customer token, `GET /dashboard/orders` returns HTTP `200` and renders admin page content (verified in runtime smoke check).
-   `middleware/auth.ts:7` only checks cookie presence, so privileged route access relies only on a token string, not role permissions.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Re-enable `router.global` permission checks in mock mode

**Approach:** Remove or narrow the mock-mode bypass and run existing `UserPermissionsEnum` checks for all users.

**Pros:**

-   Minimal code churn
-   Reuses existing authorization logic
-   Restores expected route-level behavior quickly

**Cons:**

-   May surface missing permissions in mock user fixtures
-   Could require permission adjustments in seed users

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Medium

### Option 2: Add role guard into `middleware/auth.ts` for protected routes

**Approach:** Keep global middleware as-is, but enforce route-to-role mapping in `auth.ts`.

**Pros:**

-   Isolated change in one middleware
-   Explicit behavior for demo-critical routes

**Cons:**

-   Duplicates permission rules
-   Higher long-term maintenance burden

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** Medium

## Recommended Action

To be filled during triage.

## Technical Details

**Affected files:**

-   `middleware/router.global.ts:7`
-   `middleware/auth.ts:7`
-   `server/utils/mockUsers.ts:21`

## Resources

-   Runtime verification used during review: customer token reached `/dashboard/orders` with HTTP 200.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] Customer user is redirected away from admin routes in mock mode.
-   [ ] Admin user can still access admin routes.
-   [ ] Customer can still access `/dashboard/client`.
-   [ ] No redirect loops are introduced.

## Work Log

### 2026-02-19 - Initial Discovery

**By:** Codex (workflows-review)

**Actions:**

-   Reviewed middleware auth/authorization flow.
-   Verified bypass in `router.global` mock-mode branch.
-   Confirmed customer access to admin dashboard via runtime check.

**Learnings:**

-   Mock-mode bypass currently disables all permission-based routing.

## Notes

-   This is a merge-blocking authorization flaw for demo role isolation.
