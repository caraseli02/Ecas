# Add Sample Dashboard Data

## Problem Statement

The dashboard widgets and sections may show "No results" or empty states because mock data only covers products and basic auth. For a portfolio showcase, the dashboard should display realistic sample data to demonstrate the admin/customer management features.

## Findings

**Current State:**

-   Products: 6 mock products ✅
-   Cart: Basic mock cart ✅
-   Orders: Minimal mock data (few orders)
-   Dashboard widgets: **Empty or minimal**

**Missing Demo Data:**

-   Active orders widget (no sample orders)
-   Outstanding invoices section (no sample invoices)
-   Customer analytics (no sample metrics)
-   Activity logs (no sample activities)
-   Recent transactions (no sample transactions)
-   Support tickets (no sample support cases)
-   Credit balance (no sample credit data)
-   Settings/notifications (no sample data)

**Demo Impact:**

-   Medium: Dashboard looks "empty" and incomplete
-   Low: Cannot showcase dashboard features effectively
-   Medium: Less impressive portfolio presentation

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add 50-100 Sample Records

**Approach:**

-   Create `server/utils/mockDashboardData.ts`
-   Add 50-100 sample records for each dashboard section:
    -   Orders: 20-50 with various statuses (pending, processing, shipped, delivered)
    -   Invoices: 10-20 with different amounts and statuses
    -   Transactions: 20-30 (payments, credits, refunds)
    -   Activity logs: 30-50 (login, order updates, settings changes)
    -   Support tickets: 5-10 with various statuses
    -   Customer profiles: 5-10 sample customers
-   Generate realistic dates (past 3 months)
-   Use real-looking names, addresses, emails

**Pros:**

-   Dashboard feels complete and alive
-   Shows all features working
-   Demonstrates data visualization capabilities
-   More impressive portfolio

**Cons:**

-   More code to maintain
-   Larger mock data files
-   More complex to manage

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Add 10-20 Curated Records

**Approach:**

-   Focus on quality over quantity
-   Create 10-20 carefully designed sample records per section
-   Make each record tell a "story" (realistic scenario)
-   Keep data small but meaningful

**Pros:**

-   Easier to maintain
-   Higher quality per record
-   Shows attention to detail
-   Less code

**Cons:**

-   Dashboard may still feel sparse
-   Less impressive scale
-   Can't demonstrate pagination well

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** Low

---

### Option 3: No Dashboard Data (Showcase Empty States Instead)

**Approach:**

-   Keep dashboard empty
-   Design beautiful empty states with illustrations
-   Add "Demo Mode" badge explaining it's empty
-   Focus demo on product catalog and shopping flow

**Pros:**

-   Minimal effort
-   Honest about demo nature
-   Clean empty states show design skills

**Cons:**

-   Dashboard features not demonstrable
-   Less impressive for admin portfolio
-   Wasted opportunity to showcase capabilities

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Medium (underwhelming showcase)

## Recommended Action

**To be filled during triage.** Recommend Option 1 (50-100 sample records) for best portfolio impact.

## Technical Details

**Affected files:**

-   Create: `server/utils/mockDashboardData.ts` - Shared dashboard data
-   Update: `server/api/dashboard/orders/*.get.ts` - Add order data
-   Update: `server/api/dashboard/invoices.get.ts` - Add invoice data
-   Update: `server/api/dashboard/transactions.get.ts` - Add transaction data
-   Update: `server/api/dashboard/activity.get.ts` - Add activity logs
-   Update: `server/api/dashboard/support.get.ts` - Add support tickets
-   Update: `server/api/dashboard/customers.get.ts` - Add customer data

**Related components:**

-   All dashboard widgets
-   Orders table
-   Invoices list
-   Activity log component
-   Customer profile cards
-   Support section

**No database changes**

## Resources

-   **Demo Data Patterns:**
    -   Realistic names: Mockaroo, Fake Name Generator
    -   Addresses: Random Address Generator
    -   Dates: Use past 3-6 months for realism

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] 50-100 sample records added for each dashboard section
-   [ ] Orders have varied statuses (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
-   [ ] Invoices have different amounts and statuses (paid, pending, overdue)
-   [ ] Transactions include payments, credits, refunds with realistic dates
-   [ ] Activity logs show 3 months of realistic activity
-   [ ] Support tickets have various statuses (open, in-progress, resolved, closed)
-   [ ] Customer profiles are diverse (different account types, statuses)
-   [ ] Dashboard displays data clearly and professionally
-   [ ] All dashboard sections feel complete and alive
-   [ ] Demo showcases full dashboard capabilities

## Work Log

### 2026-02-14 - Initial Assessment

**By:** Portfolio Demo Review

**Actions:**

-   Reviewed current dashboard data state
-   Identified missing demo data (most sections empty)
-   Evaluated 3 approaches to adding sample data
-   Listed all dashboard sections needing data

**Learnings:**

-   Dashboard feels empty without sample data
-   50-100 records is good balance (fills UI, manageable)
-   Realistic dates and data patterns matter for portfolio quality
-   Related to issue #001 (mock product data) - both improve mock data
-   Dashboard showcases admin/customer management features

---

## Notes

-   **Recommendation:** Option 1 (50-100 sample records)
-   **Priority:** High impact on demo completeness
-   **Related:** Issue #001 - both mock data improvements, coordinate together
