# Expand Mock Product Data

## Problem Statement

The demo only has 6 mock products, making the product catalog feel sparse and incomplete. For a portfolio showcase, this limits the visual appeal and makes the demo feel unfinished. Browsing products shows the same few items repeatedly.

## Findings

-   **Current State:** 6 mock products in `server/api/products/[id].get.ts`
-   **Products:** SmartPhone Pro Max, Professional Laptop Ultra, etc. (only 6 unique items)
-   **Impact:**
    -   Product listings look sparse
    -   Pagination not visually demonstrable
    -   Categories show few items
    -   New products section has limited variety
    -   Similar products recommendations repeat

**Demo Impact:**

-   Low: Catalog feels "empty"
-   Medium: Cannot showcase advanced filtering features effectively
-   High: Less impressive portfolio presentation

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Expand to 20-30 Products

**Approach:**

-   Add 15-24 more mock products
-   Include diverse categories (electronics, components, tools, accessories)
-   Add realistic variations (colors, sizes, models)
-   Use consistent product images (Unsplash or AI-generated)

**Pros:**

-   Fills the catalog nicely
-   Shows product variety
-   Better showcase of filtering and pagination
-   More impressive for portfolio

**Cons:**

-   More data to maintain
-   Larger file size
-   More typing required

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Generate Products with Data Factory

**Approach:**

-   Create `mockDataFactory` composable
-   Generate 30-50 products programmatically
-   Randomize within realistic constraints (prices 10-2000, various categories)
-   Keep existing 6 as "featured" products

**Pros:**

-   Scalable to many products
-   Quick to add more
-   Consistent data patterns
-   Easy to regenerate

**Cons:**

-   Less realistic variety
-   May create unrealistic combinations
-   Harder to control quality

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Risk:** Medium

---

### Option 3: Keep Current 6, Add More Placeholders

**Approach:**

-   Keep existing 6 detailed products
-   Add 50+ placeholder products (minimal details)
-   Use placeholder images from placeholder.com services
-   Focus on featured/high-quality items

**Pros:**

-   Quick to implement
-   Keeps 6 high-quality products
-   Shows catalog scale
-   Minimal effort

**Cons:**

-   Placeholders look generic
-   Inconsistent product quality
-   Less impressive for detailed views

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action

**To be filled during triage.** Recommend Option 1 (20-30 curated products) for best portfolio impact.

## Technical Details

**Affected files:**

-   `server/api/products/[id].get.ts:10-320` - Mock products array
-   `server/api/products/search.post.ts:15-178` - Mock products array
-   `server/api/products/new-products.get.ts:7-265` - Mock products array
-   `server/api/products/[path].get.ts` - Mock products array
-   Consider creating: `server/utils/mockProducts.ts` - Shared mock data

**Related components:**

-   All product listing pages
-   Product detail pages
-   Search components
-   Category pages
-   Similar products section

**No database changes**

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] 20-30 mock products added to shared mock data file
-   [ ] Products cover diverse categories (electronics, components, tools, accessories)
-   [ ] Each product has: \_id, name, category, price, stock, images, description
-   [ ] Product images are consistent (same style/quality)
-   [ ] All 4 product endpoints import from shared mock data
-   [ ] Product listings show variety and feel complete
-   [ ] Pagination is visually demonstrable
-   [ ] Categories have multiple products each
-   [ ] Similar products recommendations work with expanded data

## Work Log

### 2026-02-14 - Initial Assessment

**By:** Portfolio Demo Review

**Actions:**

-   Reviewed current mock product data (6 products only)
-   Analyzed impact on demo presentation
-   Evaluated 3 approaches to expansion
-   Identified all files using mock products

**Learnings:**

-   6 products is too few for portfolio showcase
-   20-30 products is sweet spot (fills catalog, manageable)
-   Shared mock data file would eliminate duplication (4 files currently)
-   Consistent product images are important for visual appeal
-   Related to mock data in cart and orders

### 2026-02-15 - Implementation

**By:** Implementation

**Actions:**

-   Created shared mock data file: `server/utils/mockProducts.ts`
-   Expanded from 6 to 24 products (added 18 products)
-   Added diverse categories: Electronics, Components, Audio, Wearables, Tools, Accessories, Office, Home
-   Updated all 4 API files to import from shared mock data:
-   `server/api/products/[id].get.ts`
-   `server/api/products/[path].get.ts`
-   `server/api/products/search.post.ts`
-   `server/api/products/new-products.get.ts`
-   Used consistent Unsplash images across all products
-   Maintained realistic price ranges and product details

**Outcome:**

-   Product catalog now has 24 products (4x expansion)
-   Eliminated code duplication across 4 files
-   Better showcases pagination, filtering, and search features
-   Demo feels more complete and professional

**Status:** Completed.

## Notes

-   **Recommendation:** Option 1 (20-30 curated products) for best portfolio quality
-   **Priority:** High impact on demo visual appeal
-   **Related:** Issue #002 (sample dashboard data) - both improve mock data richness
