# Replace Hardcoded Desktop Popover Offsets

## Problem Statement

Desktop popover positioning uses hardcoded fixed `top` offsets tied to `isScrolled`, which is brittle across header-height changes, responsive breakpoints, and future nav updates.

## Findings

-   `components/layout/header/main-menu/DesktopPopover.vue:31` uses `fixed` + `top-[98px]` / `top-[153px]`.
-   Any header spacing/font/announcement-bar change can desync popover alignment.
-   This increases maintenance cost and can cause overlap/gap regressions.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Anchor popover to measured trigger/header bounds

**Approach:** Use trigger `getBoundingClientRect()` (or shared header height CSS var) to compute dynamic top.

**Pros:**

-   Accurate across breakpoints.
-   Resilient to header changes.

**Cons:**

-   Requires reactive measurement wiring.

**Effort:** Small-Medium

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Keep absolute positioning inside a stable header container

**Approach:** Render popover absolutely relative to header row wrapper instead of viewport-fixed math.

**Pros:**

-   Simpler CSS model.
-   Fewer JS calculations.

**Cons:**

-   Depends on parent stacking/overflow constraints.

**Effort:** Small

**Risk:** Medium

## Recommended Action

## Technical Details

Affected files:

-   `/Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/components/layout/header/main-menu/DesktopPopover.vue:31`

## Resources

-   Review context: current desktop category/menu regression fixes.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] Popover top alignment remains correct for scrolled/unscrolled states.
-   [ ] No hardcoded pixel offsets tied to current header height.
-   [ ] Verified at desktop breakpoints (`lg`, `xl`, `2xl`).

## Work Log

### 2026-02-18 - Code Review Finding

**By:** Codex

**Actions:**

-   Inspected popover positioning implementation and identified hardcoded viewport offsets.

**Learnings:**

-   Dynamic anchoring is needed to prevent future layout drift.

## Notes

-   Treat as layout reliability fix, not visual polish only.
