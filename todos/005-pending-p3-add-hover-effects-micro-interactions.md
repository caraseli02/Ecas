# Add Hover Effects and Micro-interactions

## Problem Statement

The demo has good component design but lacks polish through hover effects, transitions, and micro-interactions. For a portfolio showcase, adding these subtle animations makes the demo feel more refined and demonstrates attention to UI details.

## Findings

**Current State:**

-   Buttons: Basic hover states (if any)
-   Product cards: Limited hover effects
-   Navigation: Minimal active/hover states
-   Tables: No row hover or selection effects
-   Links: Basic underline/color change only

**Missing Micro-interactions:**

-   Button scale/shadow on hover
-   Product card elevation/transform on hover
-   Image zoom on product cards
-   Smooth transitions for modals and dialogs
-   Subtle animations for adding to cart/favorites
-   Ripple or tap feedback for interactive elements

**Demo Impact:**

-   Low: Demo feels static and "flat"
-   Low: Less impressive portfolio presentation
-   Low: Missed opportunity to show UI animation skills

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add Tailwind Hover Effects

**Approach:**

-   Add hover scale to buttons: `hover:scale-105`
-   Add elevation to product cards: `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1`
-   Add image zoom on hover: `hover:scale-110 transition-transform`
-   Add smooth transitions: `transition-all duration-300`
-   Apply to all interactive elements consistently

**Pros:**

-   Easy with Tailwind utility classes
-   Smooth, polished feel
-   Demonstrates Tailwind skills
-   Quick to implement

**Cons:**

-   May need to customize existing component classes
-   Consistency across components
-   Subtle but requires attention to detail

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Add Vue Transitions

**Approach:**

-   Use Vue's `<Transition>` component for modals/dialogs
-   Add `<TransitionGroup>` for list items
-   Add fade/slide animations for page routes
-   Use `transition` prop from Nuxt for route transitions
-   Add smooth enter/leave animations

**Pros:**

-   Professional, framework-level animations
-   Smooth and polished
-   Shows Vue/Nuxt animation skills

**Cons:**

-   More complex than CSS hovers
-   Requires understanding of Vue transition modes
-   May affect performance if overused

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Risk:** Medium

---

### Option 3: Keep Current Minimal State (Add Only Key Effects)

**Approach:**

-   Add hover effects only to key interactive elements
-   Keep subtle and minimal
-   Focus on most impactful animations (buttons, product cards)
-   Skip complex transitions

**Pros:**

-   Minimal effort
-   Low risk of over-animation
-   Focus on most visible improvements

**Cons:**

-   Less comprehensive polish
-   Missed opportunity to show full skills
-   Still feels somewhat static

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Low

## Work Log

### 2026-02-14 - Initial Assessment

**By:** Portfolio Demo Review

**Actions:**

-   Reviewed current interaction states across demo
-   Identified missing hover effects and transitions
-   Evaluated 3 approaches to adding micro-interactions
-   Researched Tailwind hover utilities and Vue transitions

**Learnings:**

-   Hover effects add significant polish with minimal effort
-   Tailwind makes hover states easy to implement
-   Vue transitions add professional feel
-   Micro-interactions demonstrate attention to detail
-   Related to issue #006 (demo mode badge) - both polish improvements

## Notes

-   **Recommendation:** Option 1 (Tailwind Hover Effects)
-   **Priority:** Low/Medium polish improvement
-   **Related:** Issue #006 - both demo polish enhancements
