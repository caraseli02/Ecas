# Handle Cash Payment Display in Order Summary

Cash orders are processed, but payment display helper falls back to `N/A`.

## Problem Statement

Checkout now enables Cash as a valid method. The order summary helper has no Cash branch and falls through to default output (`type: Bank`, `text: N/A`), causing incorrect payment details in the UI.

## Findings

-   `helpers/payment-info.helper.ts:8` switches on payment type.
-   Cases exist for Card/Credit/Bank, but none for `PaymentTypeEnum.Cash`.
-   `helpers/payment-info.helper.ts:46` default returns Bank + `N/A`, which is misleading for cash orders.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add explicit cash case

**Approach:** Add `case PaymentTypeEnum.Cash` returning `{ type: PaymentTypeEnum.Cash, info: { text: 'Cash on delivery' } }`.

**Pros:**

-   Minimal change
-   Correct UI semantics for demo

**Cons:**

-   None material

**Effort:** <1 hour

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Centralize payment labels in enum-to-label map

**Approach:** Replace switch with typed mapping for all payment methods.

**Pros:**

-   Easier to maintain across new methods

**Cons:**

-   Slightly larger refactor

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action

To be filled during triage.

## Technical Details

**Affected files:**

-   `helpers/payment-info.helper.ts:8`
-   `helpers/payment-info.helper.ts:46`

## Resources

-   Manual code-path inspection during review.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] Cash orders display a cash-specific payment label in order summary.
-   [ ] Existing Card/Credit/Bank displays remain unchanged.
-   [ ] No fallback `N/A` shown for supported payment methods.

## Work Log

### 2026-02-19 - Initial Discovery

**By:** Codex (workflows-review)

**Actions:**

-   Reviewed payment display helper against enabled payment methods.

**Learnings:**

-   Helper and settings are out of sync for Cash support.

## Notes

-   Important UX/data-consistency issue for demo checkout.
