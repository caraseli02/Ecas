# Add Demo Mode Badge and Toggle

## Problem Statement

The demo doesn't have a visible indicator that it's running in "Demo Mode." For a portfolio showcase, visitors should clearly understand this is a demo/mock application, not a production system. A badge or toggle would clarify this.

## Findings

**Current State:**

-   No visual indicator of demo mode
-   Users might think it's real production
-   No toggle to enable/disable demo features
-   Mock data presentation is unclear

**Missing Demo Elements:**

-   "Demo Mode" badge/banner in header
-   Clear explanation that data is mock
-   Toggle to switch between demo/real mode (even if not functional)
-   Visual distinction for demo vs production

**Demo Impact:**

-   Medium: Visitors may be confused about nature of demo
-   Medium: Less clear portfolio presentation
-   Low: Missed opportunity to show thoughtful UX

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add Demo Mode Badge in Header

**Approach:**

-   Add prominent "Demo Mode" badge in top-right header
-   Use badge color (e.g., amber/orange) to distinguish
-   Add tooltip explaining demo mode
-   Add visual indicator throughout app (subtle badge on key pages)

**Pros:**

-   Clear visual indicator
-   Professional portfolio presentation
-   Shows thoughtful UX
-   Quick to implement

**Cons:**

-   Persistent element on all pages
-   May need to be dismissed
-   Takes header space

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Add Demo Mode Banner on Homepage

**Approach:**

-   Add prominent banner at top of homepage
-   Include explanation and "Learn More" link
-   Make dismissible (X button)
-   Show only once per session

**Pros:**

-   Clear, upfront explanation
-   Dismissible (not intrusive)
-   Shows portfolio thoughtfulness
-   Can include more context in "Learn More"

**Cons:**

-   Only on homepage (not throughout app)
-   Dismissible (users might miss it)
-   Requires additional page/content

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Risk:** Low

### Option 3: Add Demo Mode Toggle in Settings

**Approach:**

-   Add toggle switch in settings page
-   Allow enabling/disabling demo mode
-   Show different states (demo enabled/disabled)
-   Persist setting in localStorage

**Pros:**

-   Interactive demo feature
-   Shows control panel capabilities
-   Clear visual feedback
-   Users understand system state

**Cons:**

-   Toggle may not function without real backend
-   Could confuse visitors if it does nothing
-   More complex implementation

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** Medium
