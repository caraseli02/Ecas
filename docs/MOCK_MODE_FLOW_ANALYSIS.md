## Phase 4: Critical Questions Requiring Clarification

### CRITICAL (Blocks Implementation or Creates Security/Data Risks)

#### Q1: Mock Mode Architecture

**Question:** How exactly should `NUXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_MODE=true` change the application behavior?

**Why it matters:**

-   This is the foundation of the entire mock mode feature
-   Without clear direction, implementation will be inconsistent
-   Affects API routing, state management, and user experience

**Possible implementations:**

1. **Option A:** Change `BASE_URL_API` from external backend to `/api` (Nitro endpoints)
2. **Option B:** Create middleware in `HttpFactory` to intercept calls and return mock data
3. **Option C:** Route requests to `/server/api/*` endpoints instead of external API
4. **Option D:** Combination - use Nitro for some, middleware for others

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option A (change BASE_URL_API)
-   This may break existing functionality if not carefully handled

---

#### Q2: Cart Persistence - SPEC CONFLICT

**Question:** The spec says "Minimal state persistence (session-based auth only, no localStorage)" but cartStore uses localStorage persistence. How should cart be persisted in mock mode?

**Why it matters:**

-   Direct conflict between spec and implementation
-   Cart functionality is critical for the shopping flow
-   Without persistence, cart clears on every refresh (poor UX)

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Keep localStorage for cart only (minimal persistence exception)
2. **Option B:** Use sessionStorage instead (persists until tab close)
3. **Option C:** Store cart on server (requires mock session backend)
4. **Option D:** No persistence at all (cart clears on refresh)

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option A (localStorage for cart only)
-   Add disclaimer that this exceeds "minimal" spec but is necessary for UX

---

#### Q3: Firebase Integration in Mock Mode

**Question:** Should Firebase authentication be completely disabled in mock mode, or should it still work with mock responses?

**Why it matters:**

-   Firebase auth is a major auth pathway
-   Disabling it removes a key feature from the demo
-   But keeping it requires mocking Firebase responses

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Disable Firebase entirely - hide Google sign-in button
2. **Option B:** Firebase still initializes but `registerFirebase` returns mock token
3. **Option C:** Firebase still initializes and returns real tokens (but backend ignored)
4. **Option D:** Use mock Firebase SDK (not feasible)

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option B (Firebase works with mock responses)
-   This keeps the feature working while using mock backend

---

#### Q4: Stripe Integration in Mock Mode

**Question:** How should Stripe payment processing work in mock mode? Should we use Stripe Test Mode with test keys, or mock the entire payment flow?

**Why it matters:**

-   Payment processing is critical for checkout completion
-   Real Stripe requires API keys and account setup
-   Mocking stripe requires implementing fake payment UI

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Use Stripe Test Mode with test keys (real but test data)
2. **Option B:** Mock Stripe Elements UI entirely (fake card input)
3. **Option C:** Auto-succeed payments (no UI, skip directly to success)
4. **Option D:** Disable checkout in mock mode (not acceptable for demo)

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option C (auto-succeed payments for demo simplicity)
-   This is most practical for portfolio demo

---

#### Q5: Admin Access in Mock Mode

**Question:** How should users access admin routes in mock mode? Is there a mock admin account with specific credentials?

**Why it matters:**

-   Admin panel is a key part of the demo

-   Without admin access, admin features cannot be showcased

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Mock admin account with email/password (e.g., admin@demo.com / admin123)
2. **Option B:** Mock admin account with Firebase (e.g., admin@gmail.com)
3. **Option C:** Any mock user can be admin based on flag (e.g., role field in mock user)
4. **Option D:** Admin routes accessible without auth (security risk but simplest for demo)

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option A (mock admin account with known credentials)
-   Document credentials clearly in README

---

#### Q6: Environment Variable Naming Issues (P1 Blocker)

**Question:** The spec mentions "Env vars use `NUXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix but template uses wrong names". Which environment variables have incorrect names and what should they be?

**Why it matters:**

-   This is explicitly called out as a P1 blocker
-   Must be fixed first before implementing mock mode
-   Affects configuration loading

**Specific questions:**

-   Which variables have wrong names? (BASE_URL_API, Firebase vars, Stripe vars?)
-   What are the correct names?
-   Are there hardcoded references to old names in the code?

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will audit all env vars and ensure they use `NUXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix
-   Update nuxt.config.ts and any hardcoded references

---

#### Q7: Mock Data Storage Strategy

-   Impacts performance and code organization
-   Determines how easy it is to update mock data

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Inline in endpoint files (simplest, harder to maintain)
2. **Option B:** Separate JSON files in `/mock-data/` directory (better organization)
3. **Option C:** Type definitions + separate JSON (most maintainable)
4. **Option D:** Database-like JSON with relationships (most complex)

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option B (separate JSON files in `/mock-data/`)
-   Create organized structure: `/mock-data/products.json`, `/mock-data/users.json`, etc.

---

#### Q8: Token Expiry in Mock Mode

**Question:** Should mock JWT tokens expire after 59 minutes like the current implementation, or should expiry be disabled for the portfolio demo?

-   But expiry is realistic for production

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Keep 59-minute expiry (realistic, requires re-login)
2. **Option B:** Disable expiry in mock mode (better demo experience)
3. **Option C:** Extend expiry to 24 hours (compromise)
4. **Option D:** Make expiry configurable

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option B (disable expiry in mock mode)
-   Add condition: `if (mockMode) { return token; }`

---

#### Q9: Order Creation & Storage

**Question:** How should orders be created and stored in mock mode? Are orders persisted across page refreshes?

**Why it matters:**

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Orders stored in localStorage (violates "no localStorage" spec)
2. **Option B:** Orders stored in server-side mock storage (complex to implement)
3. **Option C:** Pre-populated mock orders only (no new orders created)
4. **Option D:** Orders stored in session (lost on refresh)

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option A (localStorage for orders)
-   Document that this exceeds "minimal" spec but is necessary for demo

---

#### Q10: Category Access Control

**Question:** The `/product/categories` route currently requires authentication (via routeRules). Should this restriction be removed in mock mode?

**Why it matters:**

-   Category browsing should be available to all users
-   Current restriction blocks anonymous users
-   May be intentional or a bug

**Options:**

1. **Option A:** Remove auth requirement from `/product/categories` (allow anonymous)
2. **Option B:** Keep auth requirement (requires login to view categories)
3. **Option C:** Remove auth requirement in mock mode only
4. **Option D:** Make categories a public route in all modes

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Will implement Option D (make categories public in all modes)
-   This seems like an unintended restriction

---

#### Q30: Documentation Requirements

**Question:** What documentation is required for the mock mode implementation?

**Why it matters:**

-   Documentation helps future developers
-   Portfolio showcase may need user guide
-   Determines effort allocation

**Assumptions if not answered:**

-   Add README section on mock mode
-   Document mock account credentials
-   No extensive API documentation (mock is self-documenting)

## Appendix C: Protected Routes Inventory

### Current Protected Routes (from nuxt.config.ts:83-88)

-   ✅ `/dashboard/**` - Requires auth
-   ✅ `/checkout/**` - Requires auth
-   ✅ `/order-summary/**` - Requires auth
-   ✅ `/product/categories` - Requires auth (QUESTIONABLE)

### Route Implications in Mock Mode

-   Must ensure middleware works with mock auth
-   May need to adjust `/product/categories` restriction
-   Admin routes should verify admin role

---

## Conclusion

This analysis has identified **47 user flows**, **89 permutations**, **142 edge cases**, **67 critical questions**, and **50-70 missing mock endpoints**. The 3-5 week timeline is **highly aggressive** given the scope.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **CRITICAL GAPS:** Must resolve Q1-Q10 before implementation starts
2. **SPEC CONFLICTS:** Cart and order persistence require clarification
3. **PRIORITY:** Fix environment configuration (P1 blockers) first
4. **SCOPE RISK:** Consider reducing dashboard features to meet timeline
5. **PORTFOLIO GOAL:** Focus on storefront and basic admin, reduce complex features

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Resolve questions, fix P1 blockers, design architecture
2. **Phase 2 (Week 2-3):** Implement core flows (auth, products, cart, checkout)
3. **Phase 3 (Week 3-4):** Implement dashboards (prioritize critical features)
4. **Phase 4 (Week 4-5):** Polish, test, document, prepare showcase

### Risk Mitigation:

-   Use localStorage for cart/orders (exception to spec)
-   Auto-succeed payments (skip Stripe complexity)
-   Pre-populated mock data (minimize runtime generation)
-   Simplified analytics (realistic but not complex)
-   Optional error simulation (not required)

### Success Criteria:

-   ✅ All storefront flows work end-to-end
-   ✅ Customer dashboard functional (profile, orders, addresses)
-   ✅ Admin dashboard functional (orders, customers, analytics)
-   ✅ Mock mode toggle works seamlessly
-   ✅ Documentation complete
-   ✅ Demo script prepared
