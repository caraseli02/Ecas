# Troubleshooting: Demo Route Crashes in Mock Mode (SSR + Type Imports)

## Problem

The portfolio demo app had multiple flow blockers: key routes crashed with runtime import errors, some protected routes bounced/failed in mock mode, and control-panel pages crashed on server-side fetches to missing mock endpoints.

## Environment

-   Module: System-wide demo flow
-   Affected Component: Nuxt middleware, API plugin, order/dashboard pages, control-panel settings
-   Date: 2026-02-18

## Symptoms

-   `/dashboard/orders/:id` and `/order-summary/:id` crashed with runtime module export errors.
-   `/dashboard/customers/:slug/control-panel/*` returned 500/404 in mock mode.
-   `/order-tracking` previously crashed on nested property access when fixture shape did not match component expectations.
-   Homepage had hydration mismatch warnings around header/notification/menu rendering.

## What Didn't Work

**Attempted Solution 1:** Fix only first crashing import in order-confirm views.

-   **Why it failed:** Other type-only symbols were still imported as runtime values in adjacent route stack files, so similar crashes persisted in related paths.

**Attempted Solution 2:** Patch only middleware permission checks.

-   **Why it failed:** SSR mock-mode API calls still used a relative `/api` base URL on server, causing URL parse failures; additionally, some mock endpoints were missing and unguarded pages still threw.

## Solution

Applied a coordinated demo-first patch set across routing, imports, SSR API base URL, and mock fallbacks.

**Code changes** (key examples):

```ts
// /Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/plugins/api.ts
const baseURL = (() => {
    if (!config.MOCK_MODE) return config.BASE_URL_API;
    if (import.meta.client) return '/api';

    const event = nuxtApp.ssrContext?.event;
    const protoHeader = event?.node.req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'];
    const protocol = Array.isArray(protoHeader) ? protoHeader[0] : protoHeader || 'http';
    const host = event?.node.req.headers.host || 'localhost:3000';
    return `${protocol}://${host}/api`;
})();
```

```vue
<!-- /Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/components/order-confirm/Details.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { PaymentTypeEnum } from '~/types';
import type { BankInfo, CardInfo } from '~/types';
</script>
```

```ts
// /Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/middleware/auth.ts
if (config.public.MOCK_MODE) {
    authStore.addToken('demo-token-portfolio');
    authStore.addUser({
        // ...
        permissions: Object.values(UserPermissionsEnum),
    } as any);
    return;
}
```

```ts
// /Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/pages/dashboard/customers/[slug]/control-panel/[view].vue
try {
    const response = await $api.customerProfile.fetchCustomerInformation(route.params.slug as string);
    if (response.status === 'success') customerDetails.value = response.data;
} catch (_err) {
    if (isMockMode.value) {
        customerDetails.value = {
            _id: String(route.params.slug),
            firebaseId: String(route.params.slug),
            accountType: AccountType.Personal,
        } as UserInterface;
    }
}
```

Also implemented:

-   `import type` sweep for route-critical files (`order-confirm`, `order-summary`, `dashboard/orders`, transaction options, and related dashboard card/settings files).
-   `v-calendar` deep type import removal in `/Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/components/dataTable/filter/Date.vue` via local range type.
-   Null-safe order-tracking reads + fixture updates in `/Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/components/order-tracking/OrderTracking.vue` and `/Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/Ecas/pages/order-tracking.vue`.
-   Homepage UX/polish blockers: hero CTA -> `Explore Products` with `/search`, desktop Products menu available at top, mobile text overflow resilience, tab stress behavior, and coherent empty-search state.
-   Hydration mitigation with `ClientOnly` around mobile sheet/notifications and mounted-only side effects in header.

## Why This Works

1. Runtime import crashes were caused by type-only symbols being imported as values in ESM runtime paths; `import type` removes these imports from runtime bundles.
2. Mock-mode SSR calls cannot reliably use relative URLs in server context; generating an absolute base URL from request headers fixes `Failed to parse URL` failures.
3. Demo mode had missing mock endpoints for some dashboard settings/profile calls; guarded `try/catch` and deterministic fallback objects prevent hard crashes while preserving demo flow continuity.
4. Route middleware and auth store now share one mock-mode key (`public.MOCK_MODE`) and a consistent full-permission demo user, preventing route gating inconsistencies.

## Prevention

-   Add a CI lint rule enforcing `import type` for type-only symbols in `components/`, `pages/`, `services/`, `store/`, and `composables/`.
-   Keep a mock-mode SSR rule: any server-side `$fetch` base in mock mode must be absolute.
-   For demo routes, fail-soft on missing mock endpoints (never crash SSR page render).
-   Include a lightweight smoke checklist before demo handoff:
    -   `/dashboard/orders/:id`
    -   `/order-summary/:id`
    -   `/dashboard/customers/:slug/control-panel/account`
    -   `/dashboard/customers/:slug/control-panel/settings`
    -   `/order-tracking`
    -   `/checkout/session`
    -   `/product/categories`
